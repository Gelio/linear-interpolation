# Linear interpolation
This repository is an application that interpolates a given function f: RxR -> R on a square, dividing it into 2n^2 rectangles.

All the comments inside, as well as the documentation is in Polish. Variable names are in English, so the main concept is easily understandable without any Polish langauge knowledge.

This project is a task for Numeric Methods 2 on the [MiNI](http://www.mini.pw.edu.pl/tikiwiki/) faculty at [WUT](https://www.pw.edu.pl/).
